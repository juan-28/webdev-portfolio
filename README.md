# Personal Portfolio Website in React

In order to get familiar with web development, I decided to learn how to create a website using the tools below. This is a great learning experience for me as I can now deploy my machine learning models and projects that I work on onto an application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Built using:

- Front-end library: React
- CSS framework: React-bootstrap
- CSS animations library: Animate.css
